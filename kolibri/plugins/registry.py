"""
Plugins are initialized once when the server starts. Here are the initilization steps:

1. Each module listed in INSTALLED_APPS (including those listed in the kolibri conf file) is searched for the special
   ``kolibri_plugin`` module.
2. For each class listed in the module's ``PLUGINS`` property, which inherits from ``KolibriPluginBase``, it's ``hooks``
   method is called to inspect which hooks it defines.
3. The callback assigned by the plugin class to the hook is registered in a module variable.
4. At the appropriate time (see below) the callbacks for a given hook are all called.

A few notes:

* Kolibri defines some hooks that are used in the core app. These can be found in the kolibri.plugins.registry module.
* Arbitrary new hooks can be defined. At the Python level they're just dictionary keys. *Do not* user integers for
  hook names -- those are reserved for the hooks defined by the Kolibri core. *Do* namespace your hooks!
* *When* hook callbacks are called are entirely up to the hook definer. The core Kolibri app documents what hooks it
  calls and when -- you can call core Kolibri hooks in your plugins too!
* Callbacks *should* be called in the same order every time, but this is not a promise!
